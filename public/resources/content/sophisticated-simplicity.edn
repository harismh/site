Behind their simple veneers lies deep design."] [:p "Multi-touch on the iPhone is a classic example. The gestures feel completely natural, but underneath are signal-processing algorithms, gesture recognition systems, and many other components working in concert to create that effortless illusion."] [:p "Other times, there are no complex implementations, just simple guiding principles. Take the UNIX philosophy: four concise rules that still find new applications. For instance, in the age of agentic agents, sophisticated models still communicate through simple, composable strings."] [:p "In programming, immutable data structures offer a similar kind of simplicity. They remove entire classes of bugs, prevent race conditions, make systems easier to observe, and greatly simplify architectures overall. But under the hood, " [:a {:href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie"} "hash array mapped tries"] ", branch factor tuning, hash encoding sorcery, and garbage collection optimizations make this possible."] [:p "Clojure made a bet: if immutable collections were fast enough, developers could drop the divide between scalar and reference types and adopt a simplier value model. This bet was valuable in " [:a {:href "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPhpelUfu8Q"} "other languages too"] "."] [:p [:a {:href "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4"} "Simple isnâ€™t easy."] " But simplicity is what remains after solving all the hard problems."]]}
