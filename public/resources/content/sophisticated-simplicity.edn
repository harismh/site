Behind their simple veneers lies great depth."] [:p "Multi-touch on the iPhone is a classic example. The gestures feel completely natural, but underneath are signal-processing algorithms, gesture recognition systems, and many other components working in concert to create that effortless illusion."] [:p "Other times, there are no complex implementations but simple guiding principles. Take the UNIX philosophy: four concise rules that still find new applications. In the age of agentic agents, sophisticated models still communicate through simple, composable strings."] [:p "In programming, immutable data structures offer a similar kind of sophisticated simplicity. They remove entire classes of bugs, prevent race conditions, make systems easier to observe, and greatly simplify architectures. But under the hood, " [:a {:href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie", :target "_blank"} "hash array mapped tries"] ", branch factor tuning, hash encoding sorcery, and garbage collection optimizations together make them possible."] [:p [:a {:href "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM", :target "_blank"} "Clojure"] " made a bet: if immutable collections were fast enough, developers could drop the divide between scalar and reference types and adopt a simplier value model.
