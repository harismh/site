Most SaaS stacks are composed of a user-facing app, a backend database, and some orchestration connecting the two (servers, APIs, and the like)."] [:p "A personal learning stack, or a system that complements and accelerates personal learning, can be described in a similar way. Below are what I find to be the essential components of such a stack."] [:h2 "Active Recall"] [:p "Active recall is deliberately exercising your memory and understanding rather than passively re-reading or highlighting. Plenty of research has already been done on this, and it consistently confirms that doing the actual work is essential. That engagement, however, can take different forms."] [:ul [:li "Explaining a concept to a beginner, a la the Feynman Technique"] [:li [:a {:href "https://fs.blog/blank-sheet-method/", :target "_blank"} "Reconstruction from a blank page"]] [:li "Writing self-standing ideas and then connecting them, a la Ahrens's Smart notes."]] [:p "Passive exposure might feel productive, but research shows this feeling of familiarity is misleading. Lasting learning requires active effort. Doing this work at the edge of your competence, in an environment where feedback is built in and immediate, leads us to a cornerstone of transferable skill acquisition, deliberate learning."] [:p "If there were one technique that outperforms all others, it would be deliberate learning. Unfortunately, its intrinsic discomfort is also what prevents many people from practicing it consistently."] [:h2 "Chunking"] [:p "Classic research by George Miller found that the average person can juggle about 7 ± 2 items in short-term memory. More recent work suggests the true capacity is even lower, roughly 4 ± 1 items for most adults. The reason we can still reason about and work with complex systems despite this limit is chunking."] [:p "Early on, what takes up several slots in working memory can, through repeated exposure and practice, be compressed into a single chunk. When we later recall that concept, we retrieve the entire chunk and its internal structure as one unit, freeing our minds to hold more ideas simultaneously."] [:p "As this process continues, we become capable of understanding higher-level patterns and massive groupings. Chess masters, for example, can access upwards of 50,000 chunks from a few concepts like openings and board positions. Eventually, this recall can happen without occupying working memory at all, leading to automaticity, or less charitably, expert-induced amnesia."] [:p "If there were one clear numerical measure of fluency, it would be the number and richness of your chunks. Methods that help facilitate this process include spaced repetition and interleaved practice."] [:h2 "Brevity"] [:p "On a more personal note, I find brevity to be another strong indicator of learning. When you truly understand something, you can often explain it in plain, succinct language. The best experts are able to take arcane ideas and explain them using a small number of intuitive analogies."] [:p "Think of Richard Feynman’s renowned lectures. They are famous not only for their scientific insight, but for being universally approachable."] [:p "The process of refining an explanation to be as brief and clear as possible forces you to organize your knowledge down to its essence. As Feynman himself once remarked, “I couldn’t reduce [a concept] to the freshman level. That means we really don’t understand it.” This is the driving idea behind the Feynman Technique. The audience is a complete beginner, often a 5-year-old child."] [:p "Strive for conciseness in your notes and explanations. This does not mean leaving out key details or oversimplifying to the point of distortion. It means capturing the essence in as few words as possible. When you can do that, it is a strong signal that you have truly internalized the concept. Brevity is the soul of wit, and of learnedness."] [:h2 "The Stack"] [:p "What cleanly connects these three, Active Recall, Chunking, and Brevity, is something I am still exploring. There is certainly more that could be added to a learning stack, but I am deliberately restricting myself to three components. Even so, a great deal can still be achieved.
